Corsair CUE SDK wrapper for Java
===

## Description
This wrapper is based on an [JNA](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna) interface generated by [JNAerator](https://github.com/nativelibs4java/JNAerator).

The `CueSDK` class provides some helper methods to access the most common needs from the native SDK, simplifying handling arrays of structs, etc.

## Usage Example
```Java
package dk.allanmc.test;

import dk.allanmc.cuesdk.CorsairLedColor;
import dk.allanmc.cuesdk.CueSDK;

public class CueSDKExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        // Establish connection with device
        final CueSDK cue = new CueSDK(true);

        // Set LED #1 to red
        cue.corsairSetLedColor(new CorsairLedColor(1, 255, 0, 0));

        // Wait some time before exiting, so we can see the LED.
        Thread.sleep(5000);
    }

}
